title: Setup a Pentesting Environment

A pentesting environment provides all the tools needed to conduct our tests. It
ideally offers also protection against attacks and allows us to control (i.e.
save state, rollback, discard) our pentesting journey fairly painless.

In order to get our pentesting environment setup we need a virtualization
software which will allow us to install [kali](https://www.kali.org) or
[parrot](https://parrotlinux.org) on it. It is best to use a virtualization
software instead of installing it directly on a computer because if the virtual
enviroment gets infected with anything or something brakes we can easily either
rollback or discard the machine entirely.

For our purpose, we will use [virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org) for two
reasons. First, its open source and free. Second, it supports more features such
as unlimited snapshots which will come in handy when we want to rollback to a
previous state of our virtual machine.

## Installation

The installation process is easy:

### 1. Download the ISO file (Kali or ParrotOS)

Any of the security versions work fine for our purpose

### 2. Download Virtualbox & Setup a new virtual machine

On MacOS open a terminal type the following command and you are done:

```bash
brew cask install virtualbox
```

On Windows, download and install from the Virtualbox website.

For **type** select **linux** and for **version** select **Debian (64-bit)**.
Both, Parrot OS and Kali, are based on Debian.

### 3. Insert the ISO file & Start the VM

Go to the storage tab and look for the optical drive option. Click the small
CD icon on the right and select the ISO you just downloaded.

### 4. Follow the installation instruction

When you boot your VM, the VM will recognize the ISO file as a boot medium and
prompt you with options such as **live mode**, **forensic** and **install**. If
you just want to get a feel for the OS without installing you can try the live
mode but here we go for the installation. From here, just follow the
installer's instructions and you will good.

### 5. Reboot & Done
