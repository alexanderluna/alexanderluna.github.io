The OSI reference model provides a framework for both designing network
systems and for explaining how they work. The OSI model was originally created
as a basis to design universal sets of protocols called the OSI protocol
suite. The suite was never used but the model became a tool for education and
development.

## Understanding the purpose of the model

The OSI reference model is a framework that breaks down the internetworks into
easier to understand components. Each component does a specific function. This
component approach, allows us to design and develop functionality to combine
components as needed. For these reasons, it is helpful to understand the OSI
reference model as it describing real-world network operations. The OSI
reference model is therefor a tool to better understand networking technologies.
However, not all technologies, protocols and components fit into the layered
model and trying to make it fit can add more confusion than anything else.

Beside the OSI reference model, there are networking architectures and protocol
suites that also describe networking technologies. The DOD model or TCP/IP model
has similarities to the OSI model but is often used when discussing the suit.
