TCP/IP consists of various protocols. The two defining protocols are the layer
3, IP (Internet Protocol) and layer 4, Transmission Control Protocol. Hence the
name, TCP/IP. Both TCP/IP and the internet were developed at the same time by
DARPA with the purpose of creating a research network. At the beginning, there
was only TCP but upon realizing its limitations its developers split it into TCP
for transmission and IP for end-to-end communication. This change was introduced
in version 4 hence the first real version of IP is 4.

TCP/IP isn't the only internetworking protocol but the universally accepted
standard. It's open standard, route friendly design and scalability gave it a
low entry barrier and wide success.
