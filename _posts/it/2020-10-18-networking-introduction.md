A networking is a collection of computers or hardware that are connected
together. Networking describes the process involved in designing, implementing,
upgrading and managing works with networks and network technologies.

A network is a system that provides its users with unique capabilities above and
beyond what individual machines and their software provide - connectivity and
sharing. Connectivity via LAN or WAN allow for communication. We can share
information and access the internet which is an enourmous network.

All this comes at the cost of hardware and software which isn't cheap and has
to be mantained. At the same time, security becomes a big part as well.
