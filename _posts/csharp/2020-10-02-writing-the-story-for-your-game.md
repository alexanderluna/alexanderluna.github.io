Designers debate whether a game needs a story or gameplay. Although both are
important. Every game has a story and every story has a beginning a middle and
an end. A common way of building a story is through the hero narrative
kishōtenketsu for instance has a 4 acts:

- introduction
- development
- trust
- reconciliation

Some games don't have stories but narratives or an order of the events. It is
therefore important to know the narrative of our game. Never mistakes story for
gameplay nor gameplay for story. When it comes to crafting a story keep in mind
three options: character, activities and world. If you want to make a good story
you can only pick one and focus or you risk alienating the audience.

When developing a story you have three types of players

1. Who follow the story as it happens
2. Who wants to go into depth into the story
3. Who don't care about the story at all

The best thing to please all three is to make the story in service the gameplay.
Incorporate more details to the story in an optional way which allows to player
to dive deeper if he choses to do so. This could be through collectible audio
tapes, looking for diary entries, etc.

Some common clichés to avoid in storytelling is the main character with amnesia
who recovers his memory gradually or the twisted ending where the ending is the
complete opposite of what the story pointed at. Both are perceived as very
cliché and boring.

When writing a story there's also a debate between suspense and surprise. While
surprise introduces action it only lasts for a short time. Meanwhile, suspension
can last for minutes and help build up audience attention. Imagine the character
has to difuse a ticking bomb. We know it is going to explode but the time it
takes for it to explode can last minutes and it build up emotion in the player.
Another key part of the story is the theme. It is the central topic of the game.
You can even have a theme without the story for example Pac-Man
(eat or be eaten). Your gameplay should be centered around the game.

End the game when the player has the feeling to have accomplished everything.
Don't leave open ends or unanswered questions or risk giving the player the
feeling that he missed out.

When it comes to leaving your game you have some options:

1. Literal title: obvious where it came from (MC name, etc.)
2. Action title: describes what you game aims to deliver
3. Punny title: a clever title that takes time to understand
4. Purple Cow title: makes the audience question why
5. Dramatic title: sounds like a movie title
6. Referential title: refers to something in the game

> Regardless of the type pick a short title. They are easier to remember and
> easier to build a logo for.

When writing a story create a bonding with the character early on. The player
should get to know the character and care about his death and story even more so
about characters that isn't the main character. A good way of improving the bond
is by introducing an NPC that is weak and needs protection which pushes the
player to care about the well being of said NPC. NPCs can provide a lot of
information about the game and greatly improve the quality of the game. Don't
forget that your character actions should be defined by their personalities.
