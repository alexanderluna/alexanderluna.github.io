Video games are about action. Violence is a common theme in games due to the
quick response actions have. However, violence doesn't have to part of every
game. If you choose violence for your game, identify early on the type of
violence from comic to intense violence. Set clear who the violence is targeted
at and how real the violence should be.

## Combat moves

When it comes to combat moves tailor them to your character. Some characters are
slow others are strong. Your moves should reflect the traits. Similarly, think
about the weapon your character uses depending on the range of the attack
(close range to long range). It is therefor useful to use an attack matrix to
summarize all the important information about each move.

- the range of the attack
- the speed of the attack
- the amount of damage the attack deals
- how the attack is executed
- etc.

There are a myriad of attacks and moves thus it is key to learn from real combat
to execute the moves more realistically. Each move should be quick and smooth.
You can combine moves to create a combat chain. Similarly, the super move should
require a charge time or combination of attacks to be executed. Each attack
combo and super move should make the player feel like an expert. However, don't
hold back from making the player miss a hit or two as it pushes the player to
become more skilled.

## Defense moves

Defense moves are just as important as attack moves. They should be accessible
with a button click. Common defensive moves are dodging, rolling, jumping,
dashing and blocking. You may as well consider giving your player an armour. As
a rule of thumb, the more armour the slower the character should move.

If you decide to introduce guns focus on how the gun works, how fast and how
much damage does the gun do. Then move on to how to aim the gun and have an
aided aiming system in place to help the player roughly predict where the shot
is going to land. Finally, answer all the questions related to ammo like speed
and number of ammunition.

Although violence is a common theme in games, It is possible to create conflict
without violence.

- adding a time constraint
- limited options
- limited space (mario)
- limited money

As you create your game you wan to create a tension and release cycle to keep
your players motivated and engaged.
