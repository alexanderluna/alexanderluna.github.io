A level is the environment where the game play occurs. It helps us to break up
the game into game play experiences and allows to keep track of the game
progress. While there are several ways to call levels, from rounds to floors and
worlds they all mean the same thing. So many levels have been created over the
years that it is inevitable to fall into the same cliches like your typical
space levels, dungeon levels or jungle levels. However, whether you choose to
use cliche levels or not, focus on creating a unique experience that breaks the
cliche.

## Where to start

It is best to work with a top-down approach and make a world map for your game.
This map is key to communicate with the developers and give the player a deeper
insight into the game to help them navigate your game. A great technique for
creating an intuitive level is to use foreshadowing. This way we give hints to
the player of what is about to happen or change. Think of an ever increasing
amount of skulls for instance to build up the scene to the last boss.

## Designing a Level

Each level should have a goal in mind or something the player should accomplish
to naturally progress through the story. Procedural games or algorithm generated
games are an exceptions to this rule. Part of designing levels is to create a
clear and distinct path for the player. Wether you pick an alley level or island
level, place collectibles along the way. That way the player knows which way to
go. In uncertain sections place a friendly reminder to help the player
understand the curren position otherwise you risk going the wrong path.

## Creating a Map

When creating a map define the scale of the map at the beginning.

- identify the player start point
- identify the enemy start point
- where are collectible and missions

Use light to tell the player where to go and shadow to tell the player which
areas to avoid.

> Walking and idle time is dreaded and should be avoided. Opt for active game
> play instead.

The key is to give your player as much game play as possible. Game play
translates to a direct action or verb. At the same time, actions should be
varied and mixed. When possible add a multi path level as it adds variety to the
game. Backtracking your players can be one of the tools to make your game more
interesting by making them revisit parts and find missing items.
