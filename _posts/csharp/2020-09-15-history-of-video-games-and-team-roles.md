Scholars define a game as a closed system that subjectively represents a subset
of reality. Simply put, a game is an activity that meets 3 criteria.

1. Requires at least 1 player
2. Has defined rules
3. Has a win and lose condition

> The game objective should be short and easy to understand.

However where do video games come from anyway ? Let's take a quick look at the
history of video games. Around 1950, MIT students in computer labs created the
first games with limited graphics and controls. Eventually Atari emerged to
create the first arcade game. Early arcade games used vector or raster graphics.
In the 80's, video games took off and various game genres emerged. In the 90's,
home systems became powerful enough to rival most arcade games which made a lot
of arcades go out of business.

Consoles became a popular choice given that you could switch between games with
a CD or cartridge unlike arcade games which only played one game. Eventually,
hand held devices became popular as well with their portable format. All this
led us to today where the mayority of people play on mobile devices. This led to
digital distribution of games through app stores.

Similarily, personal computers became well suited for games specially after they
became common in most households. First person shooter made mouse controller
games popular. FPS got upgraded to MMO's harnesting the power of the internet
and spocial components.

There is a myriad of games and genres. A game genre is a category that describes
the game. Game roughly divide into two broad categories which dictates how the
game is played.

- story genre
- game genre

Within the game genre you find dozens of genres from action to simulation and
strategy.

Now we come to the interesting part. The people behind the games we love to
play. While early games were individual efforts, modern games require teams.
Games are designed by whoever had the best idea. The game design role emerged
eventually from the artist role who is in charge of developing the game. We can
do a quick rundown of the positions.

- programmer: writes the code, draws graphics on the screen
- artist: designs characters, background and the look and feel of the game
- designer: creates ideas and rules for the game
- producer: oversees the entire game development
- tester: plays games over and over to find and communicate bugs
- composer: creates memorable music that fits the moods
- sound designer: creates fiting sound effects
- writer: writes dialogues, corrects team stories but isn't a full time position
- publisher: funds the game, manages production and takes care of legal issues
- product manager: work with development team, responsible for scheduling
- creative manager: similar to designers
- art director: manager position for game art
- technical director: review and recommend software tools for the team
- marketing team: promotes the game
