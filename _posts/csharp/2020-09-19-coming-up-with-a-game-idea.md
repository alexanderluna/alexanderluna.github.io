> Every good idea borders on the stupid - Michel Gondry

Getting game ideas is a big part of a game designer. Some good ways of coming up
with an idea are as followed.

1. Think about what you already know like songs, memory or experience
2. Read something new and expand your horizon
3. Walk, drive and shower
4. Attend a lecture
5. Play a bad game and learn from the poorly done things
6. Play differnt game genres
7. Follow your passion

In games, ideas usually build on previous game ideas. A key part of coming up
with an idea is the age of the audience. Kids like to play games that are made
for older kids. Games made for their exact age group are usually considered
"childish" for them.

A great way of coming up with an idea is brainstorm. You meet with other people
and write down each idea. Some thinks you would want to write down are:

- how a character moves
- how does a character do damage
- how does the character get hurt/killed
- what weapons does the character use
- what is the story behind the character
- what bonus items exist for the character

> game will ship in. The game box usually summarizes the game pretty while at
> the same time highlighting all the interesting parts.

Eventually you will hit writer's block. At that point it is best to take a
break, narrow down the focus, change your environment or focus on the good parts
of your game before tackling areas that are still lacking.
**Most importantly, be willing to learn from others.** Recognize which parts of
the game are not fun and don't be afraid to remove them.
