When it comes to designing enemies even before you draw them you have to set
clear what its function is going to be. Specifically:

- size
- speed
- behavior
- movement
- attacks
- health points

In terms of size the enemy can be small or huge. As for behavior, an enemy can
patrol an area, actively chase the player, guard an object, attack the player or
a combination of all of these. In terms of speed, should your enemies be slow
enough for the player to outrun them of fast enough to barely react ? Should the
enemy follow a movement pattern or have an AI driven path ? All these are
questions you should answer before designing your enemies as it will impact
their design and characteristics.

Now that we covered the basics, think about how your enemies should appear.
Maybe they spawn from one place or they appear out of thin air to surprise your
player. Regardless of how they appear, defeating them should be both fun and
rewarding. Perhaps, they hold an item the player needs or a weapon or they block
the path. Give the player a motivation to kick the enemies butt.

Your enemies should have a varied repertoire of attacks. Some interesting ones
are:

- block/break the player's attack chain
- long range attacks
- stun the player and immobilize
- heals itself
- resists certain attacks from the player

We have set the ground now to design our enemies. From robots to animals, ghosts
and plants there are many types of enemies to use as inspiration. Even objects
like a treasure chest can be an enemy. However, you may also want to come up
with an original enemy design. Whatever you pick, do try to reuse models and
animations by creating variations of the same enemy. Your enemy has the purpose
of motivating your player to defeat them. In order to archive this, the enemy
has to do a memorable act which becomes part of the story. Remember, for
instance, how browser kidnapped the princess and kept fleeing in each world
in Mario Bros.

At the end, you have to design your boss character. The boss character is a
complex character and should demand from the player to have mastered the skills
or rely on acquiring a weapon/move to give the boss the final blow. The final
boss should have a clear relation to the hero and should have a motivation to
attack the hero. A good starting point for that are the 7 deadly sins.
Eventually add a little backstory to give the final boss more depth. Just like a
normal enemy your boss needs an attack pattern that the player has to learn. At
its core, the attack pattern follows an attack phase where the player has to
hide/run/defend and a time-out phase where the player can attack essentially
creating a window of opportunity. Nothing will please your player more than
dealing the final blow so plan that step accordingly.
