Making a game requires a recipe and for games that is the game design. Games
need time to develop and polish. A game design document (GDD) defines everything
in your game. The following outline guides you to make your own GDD.

1. The one-pager
2. The ten-pager
3. The beat chart
4. The Game Design document

The length of the GDD depends on the complexity of the game. As long as it
accurately describes the game it is fine. When creating your GDD focus on the
fonts as well to keep it readable. Stick preferably to two fonts and a font size
of 12 points. For power points use body text with a font no less than 24 points.
The key is communication.

The one sheet should give a simple overview of your game and be no longer than
one page. It includes:

- dash space game title
- Target age of players
- intended software rating board (ESRB)
- story summary
- modes of gameplay
- Unique selling points
- Competitive products

ESRP is an organization that enforces rating system similar movies and read it.
Games for iOS and android don't need this rating although nudity is not
excepted. Unique selling points are the bullet points found on the back of the
game. You should aim for five USPs. Pick things that make your game stand out.
Competitive products are games that are similar to your game design. Pick
competitors that people know and are successful no one wants to finance a game
that will do poorly.

The 10 pager is a broad stroke design document. The reader
should understand the basics of the final product after reading it without going
into too much detail. Fancy fonts and ornaments are not needed. It should be
formulated differently for marketing and production teams.

| Production Team                     | Marketing Team           |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| game play diagrams                  | conceptual images        |
| punchy senteces                     | use bullet points        |
| game specific terminology           | descriptive examples     |
| reference gameplay from other games | successfull modern games |

> Follow the rule of 3. Everything that comes in threes is easy to understand
> and not long enough to be borring.

Page 1 (title page) should contain:

- game title
- intended game system
- target age of players
- intended ESRB rating
- projected shipping date
- game logo (placeholder)

Page 2 (game outline) should contain a game story summary but no longer than a
few paragraphs long. The game flow should describe the games action flow,
locations, challenges for the player, reward system, progression system,
gameplay, story and victory condiction.

Page 3 (character) highlight specifics of your character physics, personality,
movement, attacks, backstory as well as an outline of the controlls (controller)

Page 4 (gameplay) describe the gameplay and genres. This is a good point to
include your USPs, mini games, etc. Also explain the tech requirements
(controller, touch, camera, etc.).

Page 5 (game World) at images and descriptions of the world with moods it should
convey. Add a flow chart how players navigate the world.

Page 6 (game experience) describe the feeling of the game, the music, camera and
scenes. The gestalt of your game describes each mode. It will aid in building
great user interfaces.

Page 7 (gameplay mechanics). A mechanic is an item or element the player
interacts with. A hazard is a mechanic that hurts the player or kills him.
Describe about tree mechanics. A power up is an item players collect to help
them with gameplay. Collectibles can be items that had something to the game
later on. Like keys to open a new map. If you have an economy system describe
it briefly.

Page 8 (Enemies) If it uses an AI it qualifies for an enemy. Mention and
describe your Boss characters, normal enemies and how do you beat them ?

Page 9 (multiplayer and bonus material) Describe which achievements and
unlockables your player can get. What incentive exists to play the game again.
Does it support multiplayer? How many maps exists and do players create content?

Page 10 (monetization) is the game free to play or for purchase? What does the
player buy for money? Are there virtual goods to buy? Describe how the game will
use monetization.

> Keep ind mind to describe how the game unfolds (game progression). It explains
> how the player is introduced to the game.

The beat chart helps us describe how the game ends. It contains the progression
and requires:

- level/environment names
- file name
- story element for level
- gameplay focus of level
- estimated play time
- color scheme
- enemies/boses introduced
- mechanics introduced
- hazard introduced
- power ups found
- new abilities
- treasure amount
- bonus material
- music tracks

No one wants to read the GDD but it contains all the neecassry information for
the game and reminds you of your ideas. Programmers will read the GDD to create
a TDD or Technical design document. Features not mentioned in the GDD are
dificult to implement later so keep that in mind when writting your own GDD.
