When it comes to cameras there are different ones we can choose from. However,
it is best to stick with one main camera and only use other cameras for specific
game play situations. Among the most common cameras we have:

- static: doesn't change position, focal distance, field of view
- scrolling: moves the camera to show hidden parts
- parallax scrolling: as the camera moves, the world moves with it
- forced scroll: player is forced to keep up with the camera
- 2.5D: camera zooms in and out allowing parallel paths and depth
- first person: fixed and moves toward the z-axis
- third person: focuses on the player while showing the surroundings
- follow: follows the player and gives control to the player

An important aspect of the camera, is how much or little control the player
should have over the camera. If the player has too much control, the player
might break the game. Restricting and giving camera control in different
scenarios inside the game, gives us space for creative ideas and interesting
game play.

Once we decide on a camera type, the next step is to pick a shot. Depending on
the feeling and intensity of the scene we can choose from a really wide shot
to a really close one. Wide shots are useful for explosions and events while
closer shots will honor details more. When it comes to scenarios, a cutaway and
cutin shot can be used to show the character first and subsequently an object
that is being introduced. Another aspect is the angle at which our camera
operates as well as the camera movement.

Although all these technicalities are important, at the core of a good camera
is composition. Following simple composition rules, like the 1/3 rule and
keeping objects off center beside the objective, can greatly improve the game
quality.
