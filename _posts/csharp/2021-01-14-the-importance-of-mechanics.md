No game is fun without mechanics, hazards, props and puzzles. Mechanics are
objects that create game play when the player interact with them. Some common
game mechanics are:

- levers
- platforms
- doors
- boxes

A hazard is similar to a mechanic but will hurt/kil the player instead. Hazards
should make your game challenging but not frustrating. They will motivate your
player to develop better skills. Some common hazards are:

- spiky objects
- exploding objects
- fire
- bobby traps

> Do give the player visual clues as to what is a hazard.

Props are mechanics that act generally as obstacles and help make the
environment more realistic. Some ideas for props are:

- furniture
- barricades
- crates
- walls
- plants

Mechanics should demand a certain skill and strike a ballance between challenge
and boredom to create a game flow. Just like with all game objects be savvy and
find ways to reuse mechanics in your game in different scenarios by introducing
variations.

Finally we have puzzles which can be tricky to design and can require quite a
bit of assets but they are very entertaining and can help break the monotony of
the game. A common puzzle is to show your player a door and then send them to
search for the key. However you decide to introduce/use your puzzles, show the
reward for solving it in advance to motivate the player to solve it.
