Python is an Object Oriented Language (OOP) which can be used to write
procedural code as well. The procedural programming style consists of splitting
a program into several functions (procedures or subroutines). Data goes into the
function and the function returns results without mutating the data it received.
OOP on the other hand combines code and data into one cohesive unit.

If we were to build a program using procedural programming it can be difficult
to identity the different parts of our program which in turn makes it difficult
to reuse our code in another program. Procedural programming relies heavily on
global variables which results some key problems:

- data is separated from the code and thus difficult to reuse
- it is unclear which variables are modified and thus difficult to maintain
- functions have unrestricted access to data resulting in error prone changes
