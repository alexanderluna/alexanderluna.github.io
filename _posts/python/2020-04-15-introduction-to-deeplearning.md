Deep Learning is an intersection of machine learning and artifical intelligence
which is used to transform the world in various areas. Deep Learning automates
intellingence using brain like algorithms (neural networks). One of the key
parts of Deep Learning is that it makes us think about what it takes to be
human and has the potential to automate a lot of skilled labor. This also means
that there is a moral part to this new technology.
