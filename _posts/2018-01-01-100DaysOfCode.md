As the days progress I will keep this blog post up to date as a change log to keep track of what I did on each day of the challenge.

# Day 0: January 1st

Today I started and finished a Calculator Project using Plain Javascript, the main challenge were not the operations but working with the UI. Some of the main problems were:

* update the numbers typed in and the result at the right time
* get the right values from the button
* differentiate between numbers and operators as well special operators (=, remove)
* validate the input so that the app doesn't end up with multiple operators (ex: +++-4)

I have to say that day after day, I'm starting to feel more comfortable using Javascript with ES6 syntax.

# Day 1: January 2nd

Today I worked on the Ruby Exercises from `The Odin Project` ([found here](https://github.com/Mycroft1891/learn_ruby)) and completed them all. I also completed the first 3 exercises of `The Euler project`. While working with Prime Numbers in Ruby I noticed that the Prime Number validator `Prime.prime?(n)` is actually slow and I spend some time reading the `Ruby` language repository and found out that their algorithm to determine whether a number is a prime or not is about 3x slower than the algorithm I found on the internet while searching for better algorithms. I compared the build in prime method from Ruby with this algorithm:

{% highlight ruby%}
def isprime?(n)
  return false if n ==1
  return true if n == 2 || n == 3
  return false if n % 2 == 0 || n % 3 == 0

  i = 5
  w = 2

  while i * i <= n
      return false if n % i == 0
      i += w
      w = 6 - w
  end

  return true
end
{% endhighlight%}

I tested both `Prime.prime?(n)` and `isprime?(n)` with 1,000,000 numbers, the results are quite surprising:

{% highlight bash %}

ruby prime_tester.rb
(Prime) Time to complete (1 mil): 9.670435
(Prime) 78498 prime numbers found

(isprime?) Time to complete (1 mil): 2.173219
(isprime?) 78498 prime numbers found
{% endhighlight %}

This might be a future contribution to the Ruby Language but for now it requires more testing.

And that wraps up day 1


# Day 2: January 3rd

Today I spend most of the time building a blog using `Ruby on Rails 5`. I already have experience building apps using Rails 4 which I'm currently using in production which is why I'm working on upgrading to Rails 5. The is live available thanks to Heroku here: [https://immense-cove-36319.herokuapp.com/](https://immense-cove-36319.herokuapp.com/ )


# Day 3: January 4th

I build a Pomodoro clock with a graphical user interface in pure Javascript. I like the idea of a Pomodoro clock and would like to make a desktop version using `electron` in the coming days. More on that later.

As I mentioned in a previous post I was working on a contribution to the `Ruby Language` to reduce the `Prime:prime?` processing time. Currently my pull request is still pending but it passed all local tests and specs as well as `appveyor` integration tests and `travis-ci` integration tests. Over all I'm happy with my contribution so far although I had to do 2 quick fixes because of stupid errors I made to make it work.

And that pretty much wraps up day 4 of the challenge.


# Day 4: January 5th

Today was a chilled day, I just finished the `Web Development 101` curriculum from `The Odin Project` and I'm now working on the `Ruby` curriculum. I put most of my effort today into writing Ruby scripts and finishing my  `Weather API` project from `Free Code Camp`:

# Day 5: January 6th

For this date I mainly wrote ruby scripts to solve some common problems. I also took some time to organize my repo, commit some changes that were left on my local machine as well as keep progressing through `The Odin Project`.


# Day 6: January 7th

Today I progressed more through the `ruby programming` curriculum and build a `tic tac toe` CLI game. The rest of the day I spend reading through the reading material for the curriculum, ElectronJS's documentation and preparing myself for SEO course at Google here in Berlin.
